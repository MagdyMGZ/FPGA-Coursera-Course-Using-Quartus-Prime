# FPGA Design for Embedded Systems Specialization:

What I learn:

. Create in the FPGA a working system on a chip design with Nios II soft 
  processor, RAM and FLASH memory, and several peripherals.

. Understand and practice all aspects of FPGA development, including 
  conception, design, implementation, and debugging.

. Understand the rationale for each phase of the hardware development
  flow, including  fitting, timing constraints, simulation, and programming.

. Apply hierarchical design methods to create bigger designs in VHDL or 
  Verilog

Skills I gain:

. Softcore Processor Design Softcore Processor Design
. Writing Code in Verilog Writing Code in Verilog
. Programmable Logic Design Programmable Logic Design
. VHDL Coding VHDL Coding
. Simulation for Verification Simulation for Verification
